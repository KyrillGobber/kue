#My little terminal hue control app
This should be a very simple app. You can search and register on your bridges and turn on/off your rooms and zones as well as pick your scenes.

I don't want to get off my pc everytime I change my lighting, and unlocking the phone for the app is just inconvenient, so I've made this to make my life easier.

What's planned:
- Add colors to scenes, so you know what to expect for each scene
- Add brightness setting
- Add single light control
... And maybe some things more.
