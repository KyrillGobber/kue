# My little terminal hue control app

Very very simple app. You can search and register on your bridges and turn on/off your rooms and zones as well as pick your scenes.

I don't want to get off my pc everytime I change my lighting, and unlocking the phone for the app is just inconvenient, so I've made this to make my life easier.

## How to use
To not naviagate to the executable location every time, just put the executable into your path and run `kue` in your terminal.

The app will find your bridges - press the link button and select your bridge from the list, and the setup should be done.

Kue will save your bridge local address and api key in a file called kue.conf, which is located at the same location as the executable.

## What's planned:
- Add colors to scenes, so you know what to expect for each scene
- Add brightness setting
- Add control for single lights

... And maybe some things more.
